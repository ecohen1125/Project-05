# Project 5
## Implementation / Features you added
I could not get the maze we were given in class to tile properly in first person. It would look like a double wall with one poking through another. So I found a new one online that tiled properly (see Maze Generation and Assets).

A player that can move using WASD and can control the camera with the mouse. The player spawns in the corner of the maze.

I added a second camera that you can switch to with the H key to act as a hint if you get stuck in the maze.

I added a pause menu.

I added the player's weapon (axe) to be seen in first person when the player is walking around.

I added a timer in the top left that tracks how much time has passed.

I added a score in the top right that is increased when an enemy is killed.

I added different types of collectible gems that are worth different point values.
