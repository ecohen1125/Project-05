# Project 5
## Implementation / Features you added
I could not get the maze we were given in class to tile properly in first person. It would look like a double wall with one poking through another. So I found a new one online that tiled properly (see Maze Generation and Assets).

A player that can move using WASD and can control the camera with the mouse. The player spawns in the corner of the maze.

I added a second camera that you can switch to with the H key to act as a hint if you get stuck in the maze.

I added a pause menu.
