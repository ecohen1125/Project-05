# Project 5
## Implementation / Features you added
I could not get the maze we were given in class to tile properly in first person. It would look like a double wall with one poking through another. So I found a new one online that tiled properly (see Maze Generation and Assets).

I changed the materials on the walls and floor to give it a cave-like feel.

A player that can move using WASD and can control the camera with the mouse. The player spawns in the corner of the maze.

I added a second camera that you can switch to with the H key to act as a hint if you get stuck in the maze.

I added a pause menu that can bring you back to the main menu or let you quit.

I added the player's weapon (axe) to be seen in first person when the player is walking around.

The axe swings when the player clicks. If you are close to an enemy, it will kill them.

I added a clock in the top left that tells you how much time you have left and ends the game when you get to 0:00;

I added a score in the top right that is increased when an enemy is killed or a gem is picked up.

I added different types of collectible gems worth different point values, and it updates your score in the top right when you collect one.

I added a main menu scene that lets you play the game or quit.

I added an end scene that lets you know your score and lets you go back to the main menu or quit.

I added background music.

I added assets to make the UI look better.

I added a health system so you lose a heart when you walk into a goblin. If you run out of hearts, the game ends.

I added sound effects for when a gem is picked up, the axe is swung, a goblin is killed, and the player is hurt.
